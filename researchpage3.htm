I am also interested in application of mathematical ideas and methods in philosophy and economics. 
<p> 
Thanks to the good evironment for me to keep pondering provided by my adivisor Porf. János Kollár---besides several mathematical papers which made up my thesis, another major outcome of my Ph.D. years was a philosophical theory, which I named "<b><i>An Ontology Characterising the Operation of the Universe in Materialistic Dialectics</i>（一种唯物辩证法中的刻画宇宙运行之本体论）</b>" or "<b><i>A Materialisitc System Theory with Method of Ideological Analysis in Materialistic Dialectics</i>（一种唯物辩证法中的唯物系统论及意识分析法）</b>". This theory is essentially a unified and consistent ontological model of the universe, in which strong mathematical ideas and methods (<b>e.g. cyclic algebraic structure, the idea of symmetry, the idea and method of geometric modeling, and even some <i>heuristic</i> idea of compactification of moduli spaces similar <i>in spirit</i> to the stories in algebraic geometry</b>) are involved.
<p> 

 <p> 
Based on this philosophical theory, I wrote five research monographs (they are listed below, the paper and the little book are not counted) on philosophy and economics in the last decade. In particular, I found this theory to <b>have profound applications in various (if not all) topics in philosophy and social science</b>---the most remarkable one being building the theoretical economic system which integrates and unifies sharing economy and competitive economy (i.e. the two major types of economy in the current human society, traditionally considered conflicting and mutually exclusive by the economists). In the standard language of Marxian political economy, this essentially established the theoretical system of Socialist Political Economy with Chinese Characteristics.
