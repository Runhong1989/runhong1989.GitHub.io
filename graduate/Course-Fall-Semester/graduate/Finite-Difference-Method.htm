<h4 style="text-align:center;">Finite Difference Method</h4>



<p>This course focuses on the study of mathematical tools that are essential in developing, analyzing, and successfully using Finite Difference and Finite volume Methods for time-dependent problems. Mathematical structures of underlying equations and their solutions are discussed before numerical methods are introduced. Lectures are supplemented with numerical experiments using MATLAB. This course is designed for graduate students and senior undergraduate students interested in the applied mathematics. Students are expected to running numerical simulations assigned as homework problems.</p>

<p>
<b>Objectives</b><br style="line-height:1.5em"/>
This course will develop the Theory and Practical Competence capability. Upon successful completion of this course, you should:
