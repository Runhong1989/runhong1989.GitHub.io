<p>
This course covers the main results of the theory of Lie groups and Lie algebras. The students should have enough knowledge on general topology, abstract algebra, and differential manifolds.</p>

<p>
The materials consist of three parts: Part 1: Basic Lie theory；Part 2: Lie algebras and their representations；Part 3: Compact Lie groups and their representations (if time permits)
</p>

<p>
In Part 1, we first recall some basic facts about topological manifolds, differential manifolds, and topological groups; then we introduce the notion of Lie groups and their Lie algebras, and prove Lie's first structure theorem, i.e. there is a functor L from the category of Lie groups to the one of Lie algebras. Next, we prove some basic results on Lie subgroups and the quotient of a manifold modulo the action of a Lie group; then we consider the covering homomorphism between Lie groups, and prove Lie's second structure theorem, i.e. the functor L is fully faithful when restricted to simply connected Lie groups. With Lie's second theorem in hand, we can define the exponential map of a Lie group, and prove many identities for it.Then we prove that continuous homomorphisms between Lie groups must be analytic, and Cartan's theorem, i.e. a closed subgroup of a Lie group must be a Lie subgroup. Finally, we prove the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff formula. This part is based on Varadarajan's GTM 102, and some approaches in Warner's GTM 94, and some results in Bourbaki's books.

In Part 2, we first give the definitions of Lie algebras and related notions (homomorphism, ideal, quotient, semidirect product), then we construct the universal enveloping algebra, and prove its universal property and the Poincare-Birkhoff-Witt theorem. Then we give the Hopfalgebra structure on the universal enveloping algebra, and show that the category of modules of a Lie algebra has tensor product and unit. Next, we prove basic theorems on nilpotent, solvable and semisimple Lie algebras, including Engel's theorem, Lie's theorem and Cartan's criterion. Then we define cohomologies of Lie algebras, and prove the Whitehead lemma, i.e. the first and the second cohomologies of a semisimple Lie algebra are always trivial.  By using the Whitehead lemma, we prove Weyl's theorem on the complete reducibility of modules of semisimple Lie algebras, and Levi's theorem, i.e. any Lie algebra over R or C can be decomposed as semidirect product of its radical and a semisimple subalgebra. By using Levi's theorem, we then prove Ado's theorem that any Lie algebra over R or C is linear, and Lie's third structure theorem, i.e. the functor L is essentially surjective. Next, we classify complex semisimple Lie algebras by using root systems. We will prove the isomorphism theorem, the conjugacy theorem, and the existence theorem. Finally, we introduce the basic theory of highest weight modules of semisimple Lie algebras, and prove Weyl's formulas.This part is based on GTM 102, Bourbaki, and Humphreys' GTM 9.

It is probably no time to get into Part 3, so we don't have a detailed plan. This part will be based on Brocker and Dieck's GTM 98; Folland's Abstract Harmonic Analysis may be also helpful.
