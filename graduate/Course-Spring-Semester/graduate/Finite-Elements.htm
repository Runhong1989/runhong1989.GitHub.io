<p>
Over the last few decades, finite element methods have emerged as the numerical solution methods of choice for large classes of partial differential equations arising in fluid dynamics, solid mechanics, and electromagnetics. This course is an introduction to the mathematical theory of finite element methods. We will introduce finite element discretizations for equations of various types and discuss how these discrete problems can be solved efficiently. We will address mathematical questions related to the concepts of consistency, stability, convergence, and error estimation. We will further look at applications in eigenvalue problems; fluid dynamics, time dependent problems such as parabolic problems; Maxwell equations; finite element multigrid method. Lectures are supplemented with numerical experiments using MATLAB. This course is designed for senior undergraduates and graduates interested in the applied mathematics. Students are expected to running numerical simulations assigned as homework problems.
