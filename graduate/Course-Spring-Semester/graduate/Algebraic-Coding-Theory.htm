<p>
In this course we introduce the mathematical theory of error‐correcting codes and some decoding algorithms, which are much concerned in practical communications. We won’t deal with error‐correcting technology and concrete implementation in engineering. Some subjects we’ll introduced in this course, such as BCH codes and Berlekamp Massey’s Algorithms, are not only important to engineers and applied mathematicians, but also elegant. We utilize the knowledge and skills of elementary number theory, linear algebra and abstract algebra, and train the students to realize the importance of mathematical methods and thought in practical communications, and furthermore to consciously use the mathematical methods and thought in the future life.
Main contents of this course: finite fields, error‐correcting codes, linear codes, cyclic codes, linear feedback shift register.
