<h4 style="text-align:center;">Algebraic Geometry - II</h4>

<p>
This will be a continuation of Algebraic Geometry I, taught last semester (Fall, 2014)  by Professor Eduard Looijenga. For the student who did not take the Fall semester’s course (if any), he should consult the webpage of that course
<a HREF="http://www.staff.science.uu.nl/~looij101/Algebraic_Geometry_I_%28Fall_2014%29.html" >Algebraic Geometric - I</a>. 
</p>

<p>The Spring’s course will be devoted to schemes, their cohomology and applications. There are now quite a few good text books to choose for Algebraic Geometry. Hartshorne’s  Algebraic Geometry is arguably still the best in many people’s opinions. But it is also criticized for lacking of providing motivations. Shafarevich’s Basic Algebraic Geometry (Vol. 1) seems to be good book to start. Liu Qing’s "Algebraic Geometry and Arithmetic Curves" prepares for the reader to learn arithmetic geometry. There are online notes by Gathmann - "Algebraic Geometry" (to find it, one can google Gathmann, Algebraic geometry).  These notes are somewhat short but meanwhile also quite complete, dealing with schemes and cohomology and proving Riemann-Roch etc. For a more algebraic approach, a freely available online course is available on Ravi Vakil’s webpage.  I will mainly follow Gathmann’s notes starting from Chapter 5.  For the student who would choose Algebraic Geometry as his future research field, he should read Hartshorne’s book and do the exercises in that book.</p>
 
<p>
I may also follow Professor Looijenga’s format and ask students to do presentations. More details will be announced and decided after the course starts.

<p>
<b>Prerequisites</b><br style="line-height:1.5em"/>
Familiarity with basic algebraic geometry over an algebraically closed field such as AG I. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Material covered</b><br style="line-height:1.5em"/>
 For a list of materials to be covered in the Spring semester, consult Gathmann’s notes: Chapter 5 to Chapter 10.
</p>

<p>
<b>Grading</b><br style="line-height:1.5em"/>
Homework exercises will be regularly assigned and collected. Selected will be graded. We will somewhat follow Professor Looijenga’s rule: the grades will be ‘sufficient’, ‘in between’ or ‘insufficient’ and must for that purpose be handed in within a week after the mentioned date (by mail or hard copy). The final score will be based on these grades and on the quality of your presentation. There will be no written exam.
