<h4 style="text-align:center;">Representation Theory of Groups</h4>

<p>
The goal of this course is to give an introduction to representation theory of groups  and develop the basic theory of linear representations and characters of finite groups over the complex numbers. Representation theory of groups is an area of mathematics which, roughly speaking, studies symmetry in linear spaces. As an application of representation theory of groups, we will deal with some important examples of classical invariant theory. 
Topics covered include:
</p>
<p>
Basic objects and notions of representation theory: Associative algebras. Algebras defined by generators and relations. Group algebras. Representations. Irreducible and indecomposable representations. Schur's lemma. Basic general results of representation theory. Representations of finite dimensional algebras. Semisimple algebras. Characters of representations.  Representations of finite groups, basic results. Maschke's theorem. Sum of squares formula. Duals and tensor products of representations. Orthogonality of characters. Orthogonality of matrix elements. Character tables, examples. Unitary representations. Computation of tensor product and restriction multiplicities from character tables. Applications of representation theory of finite groups.
</p>
<p>
Representations of finite groups, further results: Frobenius-Schur indicator. Algebraic integers and Frobenius divisibility theorem. Applications to the theory of finite groups: Burnside's theorem. Induced representations and their characters (Mackey formula). Frobenius reciprocity. Representations of GL(2; Fq). Representations of the symmetric group and the general linear group. Schur-Weyl duality. The fundamental theorem of invariant theory. Invariant theory of finite reflection groups.

<b>Prerequisites</b><br style="line-height:1.5em"/>
The prerequisites for the course are the abstract algebra and linear algebra . This means that to understand this course, it is necessary and sufficient to have a strong background in linear algebra and a decent understanding of basic algebraic structures, such as groups, rings, and fields. We will prove some general results, but a lot of the attention will be paid to examples.
