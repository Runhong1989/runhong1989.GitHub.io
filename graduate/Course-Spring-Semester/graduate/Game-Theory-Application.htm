<p>This course introduces the basic game-theoretic models and their applications in various fields such as economics, marketing and operations management. Four basic non-cooperative game-theoretic models (static game with complete information, dynamic game with complete information, static game with incomplete information, dynamic game with incomplete information) are analyzed, including the definition, the property and the computation methods for their corresponding equilibria. Cooperation games, evolutionary games and behavioral games are also briefly discussed. For their applications, this course introduces mechanism design and supply chain coordination etc., including their mathematical models and theoretical analyses. </p>
