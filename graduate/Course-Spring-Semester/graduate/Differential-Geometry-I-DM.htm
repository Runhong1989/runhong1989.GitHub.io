<p>
This is an introductory course that prepares the PhD students for taking their qualifying examination in geometry. The prerequisites are undergraduate topology and differential geometry courses. 
</p>
<p>
This course will focus on the evolution of the notions of spaces, symmetries, and differentiations from classical geometry to modern geometry, by surveying the work of five great geometers Euclid, Gauss, Riemann, Cartan and Chern. Topics include: Euclidean transformations and invariants; classical results of Gauss on surfaces; the notion of manifolds and examples; smooth functions, smooth maps and their critical points, regular points, critical values and regular values, degrees of smooth maps; vector fields, integral curves and Frobenius theorem; basics of Lie groups, Lie algebras and homogeneous spaces; basic Riemannian geometry: introduction of connections on vector bundles, Riemann curvature tensor and its properties, geodesics in spaces of constant curvature; introduction of differential forms, de Rham cohomology, introduction to Chern classes; integrations of differential forms and Stokes theorem; introduction to Laplacian operators and Hodge theory.
