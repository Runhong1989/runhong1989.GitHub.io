<h4 style="text-align:center;">Basic Homotopy Theory with
some applications to Differential Topology</h4>



<p> The goal of the course is to do Serre's
work on homotopy groups of spheres through his spectral sequence and by
thus developing his mod C homotopy theory as done in the last chapter
of Spanier's Algebraic Topology text. Applications would be the
Thom-Hirzebruch Index formula (at least in dimensions 4 and 8) leading
to Milnor's example of a manifold homeomorphic but not diffeomorphic
to the 7 dimensional sphere. Before doing these, basic results like the
Hurewicz theorem, Whitehead theorem and Freudenthal suspension theorem
would be proven. </p>
