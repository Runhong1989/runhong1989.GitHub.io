<h4 style="text-align:center;">Matrix computations </h4>



<p>
Matrix computations ( also called numerical linear algebra)
is of great practical importance in scientific computation and is used in mathematics, natural sciences, computer science and social science. Even nonlinear problems usually involve linear algebra in their solution. This high level course provides in-depth knowledge of matrix computations, it is designed for those who wish to use matrix computations in their own research. Topics covered include:
<ol style="margin-left:-15px;">
<li>Solving linear systems including direct methods, error analysis, structured matrices as well as iterative methods and least squares problems.</li>
<li>Matrix structure, singular value decomposition. Matrix factorizations.</li>
<li>Algorithms for eigenvalue and eigenvector computations, including the QR algorithm for eigenvalues.</li>
<li>Efficiency and stability of algorithms.</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>
<b>Goals and Objectives</b><br style="line-height:1.5em"/>
Matrix computations is a large area, but the basics are pretty consistent. Matrix computations are effectively the standard language of mathematical computing.
</p>
<p>
The course provides theoretical understanding of some important algorithms. The course also provides hands-on experience of implementing these algorithms as computer code and of using them to solve applied problems. Upon completion of the course the student shall have substantially better and more useful knowledge of numerical linear algebra than students who merely have taken a basic course in scientific computing. The course shall also stimulate to independent study.
