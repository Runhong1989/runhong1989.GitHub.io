<p>The aim of this course is to give a broad introduction to many fundamental aspects of the modern theory of Dynamical Systems, yet focusing on a single problem related to physics : The analysis of the one-dimensional quasi-periodic Schrodinger operator. The latter subject has known a fast growing interest in the last decade, to which the course will relate with references and motivations while staying at the basic nowledge level. The analysis of the spectral theory of the one-dimensional quasi-periodic Schrodinger involves many fundamental aspects of the theory of dynamical systems : notions like minimality, ergodicity, unique ergodicity, rotation number, uniform hyperbolicity, Lyapunov exponent, small divisors, KAM theory, reducibility or linearizability... and relates as well to many different areas of mathematics such as complex analysis or spectral theory. Studying these notions and phenomena at play in this particular context allows to weight their immediate applicability while providing insight into their signi_cation and use in the broad theory of Dynamical Systems. The course will be as much as possible self contained and relies only on basic real and  complex analysis. Each chapter will be accompanied by exercise sheets that aim to illustrate and complete the course notes and acquaint the students with the notions and tools that are introduced.
