<p>
This is a course on Riemann surfaces with an emphasis on algebraic curves. Riemann surfaces are important to many branches of mathematics, including algebraic geometry, differential geometry, algebraic number theory, modular forms, integrable systems, dynamical system, mathematical physics, etc. Many developments in these fields find their roots in the theory of Riemann surfaces. Many advanced theories take a more accessible form in the case of Riemann surfaces, so it is very helpful to study Riemann surfaces before working on more advanced subjects.   
</p>
<p>
This course will cover the following topics:
<ol style="margin-left:-15px;">
<li> The concept of Riemann surfaces : Riemann surfaces as complex one-dimensional manifolds, as branch coverings of the Riemann sphere, and as algebraic curves.</li>
<li>Topology of Riemann surfaces: genus, fundamental group, homology group, symplectic bases, pants decompositions.</li>
<li>Function theory on Riemann surfaces:  holomorphic and meromorphic functions, divisors of meromorphic functions, the field of meromorphic functions and its behavior under holomorphic maps of Riemann surfaces.</li>
<li>Forms on Riemann surfaces: holomophic or meromorphic forms, their divisors, Riemann-Hurwitz formula, relationship between de Rham cohomology and holomorphic forms, periods of holomorphic forms and Riemann relations.</li>
<li>Riemann-Roch formula and its applications: Riemann-Roch formula, linear systems, Riemann surfaces as algebraic curves, classification of Riemann surfaces of genus 0 and 1.</li>
<li>Sheaf theoretical reformulations.</li>
<li>Jacobian of Riemann surfaces and Abel-Jacobian inversion.</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>
If time allows, we will also discuss singularities of algebraic curves and moduli spaces of algebraic curves.
