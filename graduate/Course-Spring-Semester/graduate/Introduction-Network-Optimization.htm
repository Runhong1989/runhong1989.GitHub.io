<h4 style="text-align:center;">Introduction of Network  Optimization</h4>



<p>
This is a graduate course designed for graduate students and senior undergraduates. Background on graph theory, combinatorial optimization or computational complexity is not necessary, but the students are suggested to learn linear optimization in advance.
Network flows is a problem domain that lies at the cusp between several fields, including applied mathematics, computer science, engineering, management, and operations research. Network flows play key roles in these fields, and researchers have made a steady stream of innovations throughout the last five decades. This course aims to introduce some principle network flow problems, analyze and design efficient algorithms for them. The contents include introduction to computational complexity and combinatorial optimization, the shortest spanning tree, the shortest path, the maximum flow and the minimal cost flow.
