<h4 style="text-align:center;">Introduction of Computational Complexity</h4>



<p>
This is a graduate course designed for graduate students and senior undergraduate students.  This course assumes that the students has zero knowledge on Theoretical Computer Science or Operations Research, but some basic knowledge on logic, set theory, probability theory, basic number theory, algorithm or cryptography will be helpful. 
</p>
<p>This course aims to introduce the theory of computational complexity. This field is founded in 1970', and has expanded tremendously and comprised a major part of Theoretical Computer Science. It is also the foundation of some other fields, such as operations research and combinatorial optimization. It also contributes to the development of applied mathematics. In this course, the students will learn some principal concepts, methods and theorems, such as Turing machines, classification of complexity, for example class P and class NP, problem reduction, diagonalization, space complexity, polynomial hierarchy, randomized computations, interactive proofs, cryptography, and PCP theory.
