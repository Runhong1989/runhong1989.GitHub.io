I am also interested in application of mathematical ideas and methods in philosophy and economics. 
<p> 
Thanks to the good evironment for me to keep pondering provided by my adivisor Porf. János Kollár---besides several mathematical papers which made up my thesis, another major outcome of my Ph.D. years was a philosophical theory, which I named "<b><i>An Ontology Characterising the Operation of the Universe in Materialistic Dialectics</i>（一种唯物辩证法中的刻画宇宙运行之本体论）</b>" or "<b><i>A Materialisitc System Theory with Method of Ideological Analysis in Materialistic Dialectics</i>（一种唯物辩证法中的唯物系统论及意识分析法）</b>". This theory is essentially a unified and consistent ontological model of the universe, in which strong mathematical ideas and methods (<b>e.g. cyclic algebraic structure, the idea of symmetry, the idea and method of geometric modeling, and even some <i>heuristic</i> idea of compactification of moduli spaces similar <i>in spirit</i> to the stories in algebraic geometry</b>) are envoled.
<p> 

 <p> 
Based on this philosophical theory, I wrote five research monographs (the paper and the little book listed below are not counted) on philosophy and economics in the last decade. In particular, I found this theory to <b>have profound applications in various (if not all) topics in philosophy and social science</b>---the most remarkable one being laying the (Marxian) theoretical foundation for Socialist Political Economy with Chinese Characteristics, or equivalently, and in a slightly different language system of economics---building the theoretical economic system which integrates and unifies sharing economy and competitive economy.
